# Reference Files

- `tuning.cpp`: a file containing the changes that were made to the original clblast source code that allowed us to collect the mean runtime in our dataset as opposed to the minimum.
- `reduction.txt`: a file containing a reduction implementing Portability Tuning with the greedy weighted set cover algorithm. this provides a (log n) factor guarantee on the number of variants for a chosen performance level x%.
